I studied Burgers Equation and solved it using Classical Methods.
I studied about Finite Difference Method(FDM) and Finite Element Method(FEM) and solved the Burgers equation using both these methods.
Simulated the solution using Python and Matlab respectively and performed Parametric Study for both.

In the second part of the Project, I collected data for Fatigue Analysis of Additively Manufactured(AM) Ti-6Al-4V alloy.
I perused more than 50 research papers and collected 200+ datasets for Additively Manufactured Ti-6Al-4V specimen.
Studied how the fatigue life depends on residual stresses, surface roughness, microstructure and porosity.
Analysed how different post-processing techniques help to increase the fatigue life of AM Ti64.
