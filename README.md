I studied Burgers Equation and solved it using Classical Methods.
I studied about Finite Difference Method(FDM) and Finite Element Method(FEM) and solved the Burgers equation using both these methods.
Simulated the solution using Python and Matlab respectively and performed Parametric Study for both.
